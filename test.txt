by finding this in:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3860112/multiple-github-accounts-on-the-same-computer

want to: commit as personal account and appeared in commit history of personal account

conclusion: can select multiple token for specific repo base on ssh `git@github.com` and `git@github.com-personal`. Tested by initialize new repo that is on `git@github.com-personal` - try to push commit using default token (`git@github.com`) and got 403 permission denied.

token default: `git@github.com`
personal token: `git@github.com-personal`

btw - to be seen in github account contribute history  - must set config of `user.name` and `user.email` for each repo

git config user.name "Your Name Here"
git config user.email your@email.example
